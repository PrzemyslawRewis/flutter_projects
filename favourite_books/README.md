## 📚 Favorite Books App 
App lets users build and manage a personalized list of their favorite books. Users can easily add new books by entering the title and author, view a list of all added books, and tap on any book to see detailed information.

State management is handled using **Riverpod’s `StateNotifierProvider`**, which ensures the UI stays reactive and updates instantly when books are added or changed.
